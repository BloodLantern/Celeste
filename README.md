<br/>

This project aims to reverse-engineer the C# game Celeste.
<br/>
As it is coded in C#, most of it was done using DotPeek, and what's left is code cleanup and bug fixing as some of the code behaviors are still different from the original game.

## How to build

Simply clone the project, open the Visual Studio solution file, and you should be good to go!

## How to run

The only thing left to do after building is to copy the Content folder from a release of the game to the build folder (bin/x86/(Debug|Release)). **This project doesn't aim at giving the game for free as you need the assets which aren't included here.**
